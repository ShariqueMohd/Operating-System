For question 1:

-The code for question 1 is in OS1.c
- compile by gcc OS1.c -o OS1
- ./OS1 <testFileName> 

NOTE: The output file will be created in "OS_ASSIGNMENT" folder with the same name "<testFileName>".

For question 2:

-The code for question 2 is in OS2.c
- compile by gcc OS2.c -o OS2
- ./OS2 <OriginalFileName> <FinalOutputFile> 

NOTE: Although as per OS1.c, I have created the output file with same name. So, both name should be same ie. <OriginalFileName>
