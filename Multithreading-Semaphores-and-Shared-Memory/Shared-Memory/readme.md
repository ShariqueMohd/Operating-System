Concurrent Merge Sort:-
=======================

○ Given a number n and n numbers, sort the numbers using Merge Sort.<br>
○ Recursively make two child processes, one for the left half, one of the right
half. If the number of elements in the array for a  &nbsp; &nbsp;process is less than 5,
perform a selection sort.<br>
○ The parent of the two children then merges the result and returns back to the
parent and so on.<br>
○ Compare the performance of the merge sort with a normal merge sort
implementation and make a Report<br>
**Note**: You must use the shmget, shmat functions as taught in the tutorial.
